# Project Atlas
## Introduction
From the beginning of the COVID PathCheck creation (formally known as COVID SafePaths), a web application has been on the timeline. Project Atlas intends to bring this web application earlier into the development process.

This web application will display a map with blue circles acting as a heatmap to show how COVID-19 is around the world. We also intend to add a more numeric visualisation of it with numbers being displayed on the heatmap to show the number of cases in a certain region.

In addition to the heatmap, Project Atlas intends to add a data dashboard to the web application. This would be similar to resources such as: 
https://ncov2019.live/
https://cov19.cc/

We intend to run this data through Machine Learning algorithm to give users the ability to look at predictions to see if cases are predicted to rise or decline.

## UI Concept

## Project Help: (GitHub: https://github.com/HarisNazir/Project-Atlas)
This team is a mixture of current members of PathCheck and a team that was formed during the MIT COVID-19 Challenge. We designed an application called COVID Map and rolled it out to Brazil and Chile. We always intended to merge with the PathCheck team eventually and this is our first stage. We have put all our code from the Brazil and Chile Project on GitHub which you can contribute to.

We are currently looking for people to aid in changing the UI of the map interface to make it more modern, responsive and more aligned with the UI Concept you can see above. Out next stage will then be working on our data dashboard. We have already begun some work on it and are also looking for aid.

### Technologies we are using:
- JavaScript or TypeScript
- MapBox API (https://www.mapbox.com/)
